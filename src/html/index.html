        <h2>Responsive and Readable</h2>
        <p>This is a responsive grid but it's necessarily not fluid. Other grids can fill all the available space on a page, but that's not always going to produce a readable result.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-flow-col">
        <h2>Narrative or navigation</h2>
        <p>This grid is similar to using the CSS-3 columns module. It differs in it's brutal strictness to the grid. This is intended to improve scanning for narrative/navigation hybrids.</p>

        <p>Nothing special about the elements you choose for the grid or it's items. Just add the classes and the grid will appear.</p>

        <h2>Couplets and Triplets</h2>
        <p>The grid includes 2 classes for describing how columns are grouped. If you have a total of 2, 4, 8, or 16 columns, use <code>grid--n2</code>. If you have 3, 6, 9, or 18 columns, use <code>grid--n3</code>. You can use both also.</p>

        <h2>Old explorers</h2>
        <p>Below IE 9, the nth-child selectors and media queries will not work. The old explorers will find natural flows instead of floating columns.</p>

        <h2>Nor devices</h2>
        <p>Making arbitrary choices based on device usage can be effective, but the goal here is to create a dynamic system the uses the line width constant to derive it's breakpoints.</p>
